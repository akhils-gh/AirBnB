The code was used for exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to predict the first destination of an AirBnB user. An excerpt of the Kaggle competiton from which data was used -

"Instead of waking to overlooked "Do not disturb" signs, Airbnb travelers find themselves rising with the birds in a whimsical treehouse, having their morning coffee on the deck of a houseboat, or cooking a shared regional breakfast with their hosts.

New users on Airbnb can book a place to stay in 34,000+ cities across 190+ countries. By accurately predicting where a new user will book their first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand.

In this competition, Airbnb challenges you to predict in which country a new user will make his or her first booking."
